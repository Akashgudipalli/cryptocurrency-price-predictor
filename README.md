# 📈 Cryptocurrency Price Analysis Using AI

## 📝 Abstract
Cryptocurrency is playing an increasingly important role in reshaping the financial system due to its growing popularity and merchant acceptance. While many people are investing in cryptocurrencies, their dynamic features, unpredictability, and the factors influencing their value remain mostly unknown—posing significant investment risks.

This study applies advanced **Artificial Intelligence** frameworks, including:
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network**

We analyze the price dynamics of leading cryptocurrencies such as **Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple**. 

Key findings:
- **ANN** relies more on long-term historical patterns.
- **LSTM** captures short-term trends more effectively.

With enough historical data, ANN can approach the accuracy of LSTM. This project demonstrates that cryptocurrency price trends are indeed predictable using AI models, though the reasons for predictability depend on the nature of the chosen algorithm.

## 🔍 Existing System

Most existing cryptocurrency analysis and prediction systems are limited. Previous research primarily relied on statistical models or traditional machine learning methods such as:

- **Random Forests**
- **Binomial Logistic Regression**

These approaches achieved limited predictive accuracy (~55%) due to the complex and volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets. Most investors remain unaware of crucial factors influencing price trends, leading to unreliable predictions.

## 🚀 Proposed System

Our proposed system leverages the power of deep learning models—**ANN** and **LSTM**—to predict cryptocurrency price trends more accurately.

- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** Used to predict Bitcoin prices one day into the future based on varying lengths of historical data.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** Specially designed for time series data, capturing short-term dynamics and patterns in price movement.

Both models are suitable for time series prediction in volatile markets like cryptocurrency.

### ✅ Advantages:
- Enhances user privacy and security by utilizing blockchain’s inherent anonymity.
- Predicts future cryptocurrency prices and time series effectively.
- Potential to achieve near **100% accuracy** with refined models.
- Supports applications such as secure identity verification and financial planning.
